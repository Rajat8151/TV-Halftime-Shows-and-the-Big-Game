Data Science Project 1 in Data Science with python Path.

This is my solutions to the DataCamp Project. This is a side project that is a part of the programm that will help developing my skills in Python and SQL mainly, but hopefully I'll start to get a feel for Excel also.
Each project is linked to the page (you may need a DataCamp account to access this).

The dataset used in this project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with [game data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions), one with [TV data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_television_ratings) and one with [halftime musician data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows) for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.

Let me know if these have been helpful to you!
